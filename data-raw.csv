Very unhelpful was the poor organisation in one specific course (the rest was well organized and reliable), which resulted in multiple readjustments to my schedule. Organizing study meetings with other students (remote and with my flatmates) was super helpful. Because lectures and tutorials are not fixed to a time, I had trouble taking off any day for the first few weeks, because the workload literally never stopped. In that sense, finding and adjusting to a schedule that works for me was tougher, but adjusting the timing to my needs was easier.
I have been diagnosed with depression and definetely felt that the isolation from a more active study life (as in going out and leaving work mentally when leaving the library) has taken its toll. I am very close to my flatmates which has helped a lot, but I am sure many other students (especially new ones) do feel isolated and alone with their struggles (the second semester was a tough one).  As this probably will be going on as it is for a while, we should not forget about the ones who are alone at their desk with a lot of workload and without much experience with such situations.

"2020/06/11 2:55:05 PM GMT+2","7","7","7","Initially I thought this semester was going to be an advantage and I was gonna be able to focus on learning more than I did in the previous semester. I thought that by having digital access to all lectures and material would allow me to focus on that and not having to deal with going to the university in person and waste time while enrolling in casual conversation with others would be an advantage. I personally manage very well self learning and during the summer break I had the change to experience it while doing computational pragmatics. The course was well structured and the video explanations and material was well organized. 
However, this is not the case for most subjects and that is surprisingly overwhelming for me since we (the CogSci) are suppose to deal with technology or virtual platforms all the time. Not all the professors are prepared for moving into digitalization (I think nobody was -including us, students). 
I think  since we are using digital material, just a 2 hours video lecture and 60-80 slides  will not be very helpful. That we should know from psychology, attention does not last that long-- and given there is not interaction, things are more complicated. Therefore, virtual learning platforms demand interactivity (e.g., answer a question in between video, solving x or w task etc.) something that motivates me to keep looking and feeling I follow the professor.
Finally, I think there is a delay nobody is considering .. from the time professors do recordings and us watch the videos. One can easily spend one full day just trying to find put the material on StudIp and watching videos for both... lectures and practice sessions. So, if I class on Monday 10-12 but at that moment there is not video because it is being recorded, then I have to move all my plans and work on that later in the week... aaah but true, the homework is still for the end of the week.","2","1","7","6","6","2","6","5","1","1","","","","Some classes are not well adapted to total virtual platforms. The classes are basically composed of a almost 2 hours video and 60-80 slides. That's all. Given classes are online. then the strategy should be a different one. 
I would rather watch a 20 minutes video explaining straight away what is important and answer some questions in between. 
and then spend the rest of the time researching for answering some extra question the professor formulates than just passively listening him talk ","Trying to improve the actual passive 2 hours video-slide format of the lectures would be a great start.","4","issues with technical equipment (computer, internet, ...);issues with access to study material (library, labs);finding a way to deal with this passive format of the lectures, waiting for the lectures to be uploaded, procrastination, working in groups is the worst thing ever!, not only others are expecting you to do the HW, but also your grade depend on what they do!","No","","The worst thing of this semester was me feeling as shit. Literarily, thinking I am the one who is wrong because I do not get to understand X or Y lecture, homework deadlines, my groups is not doing anything and I have to do most work because I want a good grade etc. 
Then, finally realizing that I am not understanding not because I am bad or not intelligent enough but it is the format and the (sorry to say) long-boring-passive lectures are sometimes given. I realize that it is easier and better if I just take the topic in question for the week lecture, do not spend time watching the lectures videos and just google or YouTube explanations about it. much more efficient!","None;Google and YouTube ","25 ECTS","1","a bit more","10","Yes, more than one semester more","Yes","No","No","less often than in previous semesters","No","No","Yes","Desktop/Laptop Computer;Tablet (+ Pen);Pen & Paper","Library Books","1","Blubber;Stud.IP Forum","HTML/Web","Video of slides + Narration by lecturer.","1","Vips (With Question Pool & Selftest options )","Yes","Yes","timeit, google calendar","notability, goodnotes ","none","coursera, edx, quizlet, kahoot, YouTube, Google, ","MSc CogSci","2","Very important to know ASAP","I think it would be a great idea for us as students during this ""online learning"" times to be able to access more online material that is out there.

E.g. it would be beneficial if lecturers adjusted their style for prerecorded lectures. Since we do not see each other in person, the (in my opinion silly) pressure to avoid ""just"" reading off of a script is non-existant. I'd much prefer you reading a script if it meant that the information was conveyed in a more concise way. At least one lecturer appears to utilize editing techniques in their prerecorded videos, making cuts. Whether this is to just take a break, edit out mistakes, or to select a better take, I appreciate this.

E.g. the responses to ""If you suffer from any psychological conditions, did your situation worsen since March 2020?"" does not offer an option for declaring that, on the contrary, my mental situation improved by a lot. People don't seem to consider that previous conditions might not have been ideal for everybody involved, and that instead of ""coping"" with the current situation, some students may be rejoicing at the new opportunities given to them. --- It is important to consider that, just as some students suffer under the new circumstances, others suffered under the old ones and it is only now that they can realize their full potential.

I know that it is hard to make predictions e.g. regarding exam dates, but for working reasons in the semester break (because it is hard to get a job right now) it would be absolutetly crucial to know when exams will take place. Still in some courses there are still no dates for the 2. attempts or even for the 1. attempts. Also the retake exams are announced on very short notice, or are sheduled in the middle of my exam phase or on dates I already have to write another exam. Therefore I would have to write 6 exams, partially on the same day, in about 20 days. Since I do not have retake dates, it is not easy to shedule them to the retake dates. Because another probelm occuring is, that I still need my 40 ECT and some retakes are sheduled in the next semester. Additionally, learning for exams in groups and doing homework in groups is diffucult as well. Therefore I think this semester will very much be to my disatvantage. "

"2020/06/12 12:49:41 PM GMT+2","5","4","5","A few classes are way more complicated than they should be. It is quite annoying if the lecturer doesnt really care about how the material is given to the students. There are some classes who do an excellent job. I especially like how (e.g. in theoretische informatik) courseware is used to divide lectures into topics, instead of 90min. each and how the lecturer also used a whiteboard in addition to the slides to explain the material. But other lectures are just so bad, the audio is hardly to understand, the slides are cut off, the lecturer refers to ""as you can see here"", but you cannot see where he is pointing at, lectures are missing and the slides aren't really comprehensible without good explanation, etc. And that makes it actually really hard and demotivates a lot. You need to invest so much more time into the course and it is quite annoying that you know, that just with a little effort by the lecturer it could be so much easier for the student. Everyone needs to get used to that new format, and first has to put some work into it, students and lecturers equally.
Another point are the exams, it is almost end of the semester, but for some classes there is still absolutely no information about the exams, the only information you get is, we dont know yet. That definitely is a stressing point for me. And also in one class an online exam just got explained and the concept of that for me personally sounds really stressful and i would prefer a normal exam 10000 times over that online exam, having to put a camera in my room and personal space, stressing out if the internet connection might resists and so on...
