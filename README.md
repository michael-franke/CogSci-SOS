# CogSci SOS (Survey on the Online Semester)

Data and visualization scripts from a survey among students of Cognitive Science regarding their experience with the Cov-19 induced "digital semester" (summer term 2020).

The report can be found [here](https://michael-franke.github.io/CogSci-SOS/report.html).

Data Set: In order to prevent cross inference and thereby guard students anonymity, the cells in each column of the original data set are randomized.
