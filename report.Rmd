# Questions about problems

INSERT TEXT: Motivation behind this question set (copy-paste in part from survey).

## Q4.1: "How problematic was the summer term 2020 for you in general?"

The question asked was "How problematic was the summer term 2020 for you in general?". Answers could be given on a 10-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (= very easy / no problems at all) to 10  (= very problematic / many problems). The distribution of answers is shown below. 

```{r}
d_problems %>% 
  # mutate(`how problematic` = as.character(`how problematic`)) +
  ggplot(aes(x = `how problematic`)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = 1:10) +
  labs(
    x = "rating",
    y = "frequency",
    title = "How problematic was the SS 2020 in general (1 = easy; 10 = hard)?"
  )
